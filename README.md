# EpiSimCH
### Epicemic simulation with geodata from Switzerland
Simulation of 8 Mio. individiuals. The simulation is driven by a social network and arbitrary contacts.
The software is not based on scientific evidence - as usual it a freestyle product of myself ;-)
* Uses geodata from switzerland
* First Step: Create a social network
* Second Step: Run simulation
* Graphical output with data for every municipality or in diagramms (K0 value, recovered, deceased,...)
* Runnung on 4 Threads, use at minimum 8GB of RAM
* More information on my homepage: [littlelab.ch](https://littlelab.ch/coding/#episim)
